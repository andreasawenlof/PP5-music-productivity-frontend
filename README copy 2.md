Music Productivity Readme
Music Productivity App

🎵 Introduction

The Music Productivity App is designed for composers, producers, and music industry professionals to streamline their workflow. It’s more than just a tracking tool—it’s a collaborative hub where teams can efficiently manage their projects, track progress, and maintain clear communication with supervisors, reviewers, and publishers.

This app eliminates tedious admin work so composers can focus on creativity, making it easier to organize tracks, assign roles, and keep everything structured within one intuitive system.

✨ Features & User Roles

👨‍🎤 Composers (Full Access)
✔ Create, edit, and delete tracks. ✔ Assign moods, genres, instruments, project type, and track status. ✔ Mark tracks as “Ready for Review” when completed. ✔ Manage comments—a conversation thread per track for easy collaboration. ✔ Assign themselves to tracks so teammates can see who’s working on what. ✔ Future Features: Manage albums, upload audio files, advanced search filters.

🎼 Reviewers (Limited Access)
✔ Only see tracks marked as “Ready for Review.” ✔ Listen to tracks (Future Feature) and provide structured feedback. ✔ Cannot create or edit tracks—only review & communicate. ✔ Set Review Status to "Needs Revision" if changes are required. ✔ Engage in a separate review thread (not the composer comments) for structured feedback. ✔ Review History: Keep track of past feedback & revisions. ✔ Composers reply as a team (no individual names shown) to promote unity. ✔ Revision Counter: Composers track how many times a piece has been revised (private to composers). ✔ Mark a track as "Completed and Revised" when approved.

🔍 Filtering & Searching

To make navigating hundreds of tracks easier, the app includes powerful filtering options: ✔ Search by title ✔ Filter by:

Genre
Mood
Status (Not Started, In Production, Ready for Mixing, Ready for Review)
Project Type
Vocals Needed (Yes/No)
Future Feature: More advanced filtering & search functionalities.

🔥 Comments & Reviews

🎤 Comments (For Composers Only)
✔ Each track has its own dedicated comment thread. ✔ Used for team communication & quick collaboration. ✔ Owners can edit & delete their own comments. ✔ Avatar links to composer profiles (Future Feature).

📝 Review Feedback (For Reviewers & Composers)
✔ Separate from composer comments (structured feedback system). ✔ Reviewer can set track status to “Needs Revision.” ✔ Composers respond as a team (no individual names displayed). ✔ Review history log keeps track of all revisions. ✔ Revision counter (composers only) to track how many times a track was revised. ✔ Reviewer marks track as “Completed and Revised” when done.

🚀 Future Features

💿 Albums – Tracks can belong to albums, allowing bulk updates & separate album comments. 🎧 Audio File Uploads – Composers can attach sound files for easy reference. 🔎 Enhanced Search & Filters – More precise ways to find tracks & comments. 🎼 Instrument Management – Create & categorize instruments within the system. 📈 Dashboard & Analytics – Insights into track progress & team activity.

🔥 This keeps everything transparent, structured, and easy to navigate. Composers don’t waste time searching for feedback, and reviewers get a clear overview of tracks that need attention. The goal? More music, less admin. 🎶
