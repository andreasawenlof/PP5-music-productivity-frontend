🎵 **Introduction**

The **Music Productivity App** is designed for composers, producers, and music industry professionals to streamline their workflow. It’s more than just a tracking tool—it’s a **collaborative hub** where teams can efficiently manage their projects, track progress, and maintain clear communication with supervisors, reviewers, and publishers.

This app eliminates tedious admin work so composers can focus on creativity, making it easier to organize tracks, assign roles, and keep everything structured within one intuitive system.
